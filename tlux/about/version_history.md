| 0.0.2<br>February 2022 | Fixing pip install errors. |
| 0.0.3<br>February 2022 | Added well spaced random designs over the box and <br> ball. |
| 0.0.4<br>February 2022 | Added 'approximate' and support for generic surface <br> points in 'Plot.add_function'. |
| 0.0.5<br>March 2022 | APOS model added to library. |
| 0.0.6<br>March 2022 | Added math library utilities, included update ratio <br> in APOS model training record. |
| 0.0.7<br>March 2022 | Added missing import to random box function. |
| 0.0.8<br>March 2022 | Updating setup script to attempt Fortran compilation <br> early. |
| 0.0.9<br>March 2022 | Updated memory layout and incorporated SVD into data <br> normalization. Modified adaptive parameter update to <br> use a sliding linear number of parameters instead of <br> the binary search protocol. |

| 0.0.10<br>March 2022 | Removing APOS compiler overrides. |
| 0.0.11<br>March 2022 | Made initial apositional model output normalized <br> correctly to zero mean and unit variance. |
| 0.0.12<br>April 2022 | Updated work size to int64 type. |
| 0.0.13<br>April 2022 | Preventing negative array sizes and numbers of <br> threads. |
| 0.0.14<br>April 2022 | Cleaned APOS memory usage, disabled compiled fmath, <br> added testing codes for least squares fits. |
| 0.0.15<br>April 2022 | Added large format testing for APOS and parallelized <br> the evaluation of internal state rank. |
| 0.0.16<br>April 2022 | Modified APOS fit routines to allow weighting the <br> value of individual Y with the new parameter YW. |
| 0.0.17<br>April 2022 | Minor patch, prevent division by zero in <br> CONDITION_MODEL. |
| 0.0.18<br>April 2022 | Implemented numpy evaluation class without need for <br> compiled code. Added EQUALIZE_Y configuration to <br> determine whether Y principal components are <br> flattened. Made default <br> ORTHOGONALIZING_STEP_FREQUENCY=0 to disable the <br> orthogonalizing entirely. |
| 0.0.19<br>April 2022 | Fixed a few bugs introduced after version 15. Now <br> refactored code still converges correctly for <br> apositional inputs. |
| 0.0.20<br>May 2022 | Added fast ball tree nearest neighbor codes to the <br> 'approximate' subpackage. |
